CustomSamplers

The CustomSamplers project is an extension to JMeter that contains
custom configurations and samplers for different databases in order
to measure performance attributes of binary data handling.

Currently the following databases are supported by configuration and sampler elements:
NoSQL:
 - Cassandra
 - RIAK
 - MongoDB
 - CouchDB
 
NewSQL:
 - ???

Relational:
 - PostgreSQL
 - MySQL
 
 TODO:
 - Cassandra: Check Quorum write and read, and unify the numbers for all the tests.
 - RIAK: Same as for Cassandra. Quorum writen, ONE read probably the best.
 - Extend MongoDB with Morphia POJO mapping. (??? Probably not a good idea...)
 - CouchDB - Base64 encoding flaw? What cause it?
 - Add missing DB samplers.
 - Unify QuryHandling.
 - Unify test databases and clusters
